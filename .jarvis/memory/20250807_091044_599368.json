  "content": "To update the application within a `uv`-managed virtual environment, the system checks for the existence of the `uv` executable in `sys.prefix` (`bin` for Unix, `Scripts` for Windows). If found, it uses the command `uv pip install -e .` for installation, otherwise, it falls back to the standard `python -m pip install -e .`. This logic is implemented in `src/jarvis/jarvis_utils/git_utils.py`.\n",
