  "content": "Decision: Persist each statistic as an individual file under src/jarvis/jarvis_stats. \n- File name: metric name\n- File content: the metric value\n- Update policy: whenever the metric changes, write the file (atomic write)\n- Startup behavior: read all metric files at startup; if a metric file is missing, compute it once and save it\n- Goal: Avoid expensive real-time computation (utils.py stats display is too slow)\n- Notes: Ensure compatibility with existing stats API; minimal invasive changes; handle missing/invalid files gracefully.\n",
