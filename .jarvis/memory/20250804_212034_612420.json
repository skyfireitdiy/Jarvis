  "content": "A new configuration option `JARVIS_FORCE_SAVE_MEMORY` has been added in `src/jarvis/jarvis_utils/config.py`. It's a boolean that defaults to `True`. When `True`, Jarvis will prompt the user to save important information before summarizing conversation history or at the end of a task. This can be disabled by setting `JARVIS_FORCE_SAVE_MEMORY: false` in the `config.yaml` file.\n",
